to flash these binarys you need the esptool.py program.

On linux it requires phyton being installed obviously.

On windows there is an exe version    https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases

They both use the same syntax.

The syntax (used by my make flash command) is as follows: (adjust pathnames and tty-port as appropriate)

python path/esptool.py
--chip esp32 --port "/dev/ttyUSB0" --baud 921600 --before "default_reset" --after "hard_reset"
write_flash -z --flash_mode "dio" --flash_freq "80m" --flash_size detect
0x1000 path/bootloader.bin
0x10000 path/espcam.bin
0x8000 path/partitions.bin
